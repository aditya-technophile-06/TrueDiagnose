## 📖 Project Overview

True Diagnose is a machine learning-powered web application designed to assist in medical diagnosis. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning models trained on large datasets to predict various diseases based on user-provided medical data. The system enables users to detect potential health issues and schedule appointments with doctors if needed. The application also offers a secure communication feature via email between patients and doctors, providing a streamlined healthcare experience.

## ❓Why This Project?

Errors in human diagnosis are inevitable, but machine learning models can significantly improve the accuracy of medical predictions. By harnessing the power of AI, we ensure more reliable health assessments. Extensive research in allopathic, homeopathic, and ayurvedic fields led us to utilize allopathic datasets due to the availability of data. This project uses datasets sourced from Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning repositories for accurate health predictions.
